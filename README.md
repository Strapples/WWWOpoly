Thanks to Our First Forks Team! ðŸŽ‰
(First 10 people to fork get a public thanks and a permanent place in the README.md!)
	1.	@luvnft/WWWOpoly â€“ Thanks for forking my project! Youâ€™ve got some awesome code projects on your sideâ€”donâ€™t be surprised if I fork one in return. Enjoy working with the dev build, and if you get new features working, feel free to submit a pull request!

I love collaboration, and Iâ€™ve selected Vue as the front end. If you plan to contribute on UI, stick with Vue to keep everything streamlined. Thanks again, and if youâ€™re watching or using parts of my tech stack for your own project, I appreciate it!

For those waiting for the full build of the game, expect it within the next 12-24 months! ðŸš€
