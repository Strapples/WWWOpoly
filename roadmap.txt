Consolidated WWWOpoly Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Game Mechanics
1. User Registration and Authentication
    * Secure user registration, login, JWT-based authentication, and basic profile management.
2. Link Ownership and Claiming System
    * Users can claim links, pay a toll, and earn income from link ownership.
    * Planned: Allow custom link categories and an admin approval system for new categories.
3. Basic Leaderboard System
    * Implement leaderboards for stats such as most sites owned, credits earned, and achievements unlocked.

Phase 2: Special Event Links (WIP)
* Description: Introduce rare or special links that grant unique bonuses when claimed or visited.
* Steps:
    * Define special properties (e.g., one-time bonus, temporary toll boost, exclusive badge).
    * Randomly spawn these links, triggered by specific actions (e.g., after a user completes a mission).
    * Notify users when special links become available to encourage competition.
* Benefits: Adds excitement and scarcity, encouraging regular player engagement.
Current Status: WIP — this is the next priority for implementation.

Phase 3: User Profiles and Leaderboard Customization
1. User Profile Customization
    * Description: Allow users to personalize profiles, including avatars and preferred leaderboard stats.
    * Steps:
        * Add profile fields in the User model for avatar and customization preferences.
        * Allow users to view other players’ profiles, enhancing social elements and competition.
    * Benefits: Adds identity and social aspects to the game.
2. Expanded Leaderboard Options
    * Enable players to select which leaderboard stats they want to display on their dashboards.

Phase 4: Global Economy and Analytics
1. Global Economy System
    * Description: Track in-game economic metrics that affect tolls, upgrade costs, and generator maintenance fees.
    * Steps:
        * Set up global economy adjustments based on player activity and overall game metrics.
        * Implement dynamic inflation/deflation, adjusting costs for gameplay elements.
    * In-Game Notifications and UI:
        * Display global economy status, leaderboards, and milestones in the UI.
        * Notify users about leaderboard rank changes, achievements, and daily missions.
    * Admin Panel (Optional):
        * Admin controls for managing economy settings, overseeing leaderboards, and adjusting inflation thresholds.
    * Testing and Optimization:
        * Load test database and backend performance, especially for high-read endpoints.
        * Cache frequently accessed data like leaderboards for improved performance.

Phase 5: Referral System
* Description: Encourage user growth by rewarding players for inviting friends.
* Steps:
    * Generate unique referral codes for users.
    * Track users who join via referral and reward both inviter and new user.
* Benefits: Expands the player base and incentivizes active users to bring in new players.

Phase 6: Weekly Tournaments and Prizes
1. Weekly Tournaments
    * Description: Set up weekly tournaments based on specific metrics (e.g., most sites visited, highest toll collected).
    * Steps:
        * Implement a tournament tracking system that resets each week.
        * Track stats and rank players in real-time.
        * Award prizes or badges to top players at the end of each tournament.
    * Benefits: Adds competition and incentives for regular logins and gameplay.

Phase 7: In-App Purchases and Premium Features
1. In-App Purchase of Credits
    * Enable players to purchase in-game credits for real money, facilitating faster progress.
2. Premium Generators (Solar Generator)
    * Allow purchase of premium items, like a maintenance-free solar generator with high initial cost but no fuel requirements.

Potential Future Features and Advanced Enhancements
1. Admin Panel for Moderation
    * Implement an admin interface to review and manage user reports, flagged or dead links, and manual achievement grants.
2. Expanded Leaderboard System
    * Leaderboards for additional categories like most achievements unlocked, credits spent, or links visited.
3. Social and Friend Features
    * Enable users to follow each other, view each other’s profiles, and engage socially.
4. Advanced Analytics and Insights
    * Provide players with detailed activity analytics (e.g., most visited links, highest toll collections) for better gameplay insights.
5. Automated Testing Suite
    * Add unit tests and integration tests for core game functionality to ensure stability as codebase grows.
