### Game Mechanics

The core gameplay of WWWOpoly revolves around link ownership, tolls, and strategic sharing:

- **Claim Links**: Players receive random web links from a database and can "claim" ownership by visiting and claiming them. Claimed links become part of the player's "empire."
- **Tolls**: When other players visit a claimed link, a small credit (or "toll") is deducted from the visitorâ€™s account and credited to the owner.
- **Points and Leaderboard**: Players earn points for claiming links and collecting tolls. A leaderboard ranks players based on points, fostering competition.
- **Credits**: Players start with a set amount of credits, which they spend to pay tolls and earn through toll collection from other users visiting their links.

### Project Overview

**WWWOpoly** is built with a traditional web stack:

- **Backend**: Node.js and Express are used to handle API requests and game logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB stores user profiles, link data, and transaction logs.
- **Frontend**: (To be developed) React or Vue.js will provide the game's user interface.
